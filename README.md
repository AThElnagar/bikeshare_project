# bikeshare_project
In this project, i used Python to explore data related to bike share systems 
for three major cities in the United Statesâ€”Chicago, New York City, and Washington
the written code was to import the data and answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics.


The Datasets
Randomly selected data for the first six months of 2017 are provided for all three cities. 
All three of the data files contain the same core six (6) columns:

Start Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:07:57)
End Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:20:53)
Trip Duration (in seconds - e.g., 776)
Start Station (e.g., Broadway & Barry Ave)
End Station (e.g., Sedgwick St & North Ave)
User Type (Subscriber or Customer)
